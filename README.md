## Project Description:

This project focuses on integrating a public API and visualizing real-time data using Python. The application fetches weather forecast data from the OpenWeatherMap API, processes it, and displays insightful visualizations through an interactive dashboard built with Matplotlib.

Users can enter any city name, and the system retrieves real-time temperature, humidity, and weather condition data. The information is displayed in both tabular and graphical formats, allowing users to easily understand weather trends over time.

## Technologies Used:
(1).Python (for scripting and data handling)
(2).Matplotlib / Pandas (for data visualization and analysis)
(3).Requests (for fetching data from API)
(4).OpenWeatherMap API (as the public data source).

## Key Features:
1.Integration of external API for real-time data retrieval
2.User input for dynamic city-based weather data
3.Visualization of temperature and humidity trends
4.Interactive and user-friendly dashboard
5.Error handling for invalid API keys or city names.

## How It Works:
1. The user enters a *city name* in the dashboard.  
2. The app sends a *GET request* to the OpenWeatherMap API.  
3. The response is processed using *Pandas DataFrame*.  
4. Weather parameters (temperature, humidity, etc.) are plotted using *Matplotlib*.  
5. The dashboard displays both *charts* and *data tables* in real time.
## OUTCOME:
    This project highlights how Python can be used to connect APIs, analyze data, and create interactive visual dashboards.
It serves as a foundation for advanced data analytics and visualization projects.
